(QENG-1813) Use puppet-server service names

Previously, when executing AIO acceptance tests, the beaker method
`with_puppet_running_on` would attempt to start and stop the
`puppetmaster` service. This is because the AIO defaults for
`puppetservice` and related conf.d were not specified, and would
fallback to the FOSS defaults.

This commit updates the AIO defaults to match the `puppetserver`
service, and related conf.d.
```

```
(QENG-1812) Print beaker ssh environment

Beaker sets the PATH and RUBYLIB environment variables in
~/.ssh/environment, but it was previously difficult to tell what the end
result was.

This commit cats the ~/.ssh/environment file so we know what the PATH
and RUBYLIB environment variables are for the current SSH session.

(QENG-1809) removed master path resets for AIO test setups

Originally, I had assumed that machines with the master role would keep their old paths, or be updated
with a completely new set.  It looks like the master pathing will actually be based upon the agent though,
since masters will be installed on top of agents now

(maint) Add ruby to windows PATH

Previously, beaker would add `puppetbindir` to the `~/.ssh/environment`,
which on Windows, excluded the ruby that the MSI installs. As a result,
puppet setup steps that rely on `gem`, e.g. when adding sources, would
fail.

This commit adds the ruby in the MSI to the `~/.ssh/environment` simply by
it being included in `puppetbindir`. Note the actual location depends on
whether we are installing x86 puppet on x64 windows, or not, so we
include both possibilities like we do for puppet's main bin directory.

Right now, if you try to run a beaker test with the docker hypervisor and Docker is not running, you get a big stack trace:



Hypervisor for debian-7 is docker

(PDB-1034) Ezbake changes to get PDB source based builds working

This involves a rework of the ezbake_utils to provide more capability to fully
install PuppetDB using these helpers.

* Some of the original API has been simplified, and the YAGNI parts removed
  since no one was using them today.
* We now do the lein install process, but using a local maven repository to
  avoid collision with other projects running on the same host.
* install_termini_from_ezbake now added to install that component
* I've switched to using the install.sh methodology on ezbake.
* This now is compatible with lein-ezbake.
* ezbake_local_cmd has been added to generalize this kind of system invocation
  and simplify testing.
* ezbake_installsh generalizes the way we invoke install.sh, and simplifies testing.
* install_ezbake_tarball_on_host has been created to generalize this step for
  the termini and service based installations to re-use. Its idempotent, in
  that it checks to ensure its not already installed.
* conditionally_clone was modified to support being passed a branch if required,
  so in the future we can simplify working on a development branch.
* Lots of yarddoc cleanups
* Some rspec coverage

Because of the functionality within do_scp_to which allows certain files and
directories to be ignored when copying, each specific file/directory is copied
individually. In the existing code the source and target paths are effectively
the same, causing directories to be copied as subdirectories of themselves.
This commit ensures that all files and directories are copied to their parent
directories.

(gh-585) Add support for vagrant 1.7.x

As of version 1.7.x, vagrant will replace the default insecure keypair with a
randomly generated keypair on first 'vagrant up'. As a result the generated
ssh configs have changed and contain per-host private keys. Beaker was
breaking the path to these new private key files due to a substitution which
wasn't sufficiently constrained (the path to the private key now contains the
hostname, which was being replaced with the host's IP). This commit adds the
necessary constraint.

(PUP-3770) Fix copying module files to guest

In certain scenarios, no module files are copied to the guest. I have found this issue with modules residing under `/vagrant/module_path` and `/home/ci/.../module_path`.

The regexp generated was `/(?-mix:((\/|\A).bundle(\/|\z))|((\/|\A).git(\/|\z))|((\/|\A).idea(\/|\z))|((\/|\A).vagrant(\/|\z))|((\/|\A).vendor(\/|\z))|((\/|\A)acceptance(\/|\z))|((\/|\A)spec(\/|\z))|((\/|\A)tests(\/|\z))|((\/|\A)log(\/|\z))|((\/|\A).(\/|\z))|((\/|\A)..(\/|\z)))/`. I tested this pattern in http://rubular.com/ and found that indeed it matches all files under those directories.

The string substitution was not doing anything at all (`"\."` gets expanded to `.` instead of `\.`).

It was also only trying to replace the first `.` of each entry as it was using `String#sub` instead of `String#gsub`.

Once that was fixed, beaker worked.

(QENG-1454) Allow user to specify ports to open on ec2

Previous to this commit, the list of ports that beaker should open for
ec2 was hard coded and incomplete. For example it was missing port
'5432' for the database node, which is the port postgresql uses.
This commit adds the ability for a user to specify additional ports to open
in their `hosts.cfg` file. By allowing this, it should provide some
flexibility to the hard coded nature of the ports, and allow beaker to
just provide the defaults that are currently known.

Bump aws-sdk to v1.57.0 for eu-central-1 support

Prior to this commit, we pinned aws-sdk to v1.42.0. Today, AWS brought
the eu-central-1 datacenter online. When Beaker attempts to run its
zombie killer script(s), the AWS SDK doesn't know how to handle this
datacenter. To combat the issue, AWS released v1.57.0 of the aws-sdk gem
today to coincide with this datacenter being brought online.

This commit modifies Beaker's Gemspec to use aws-sdk v1.57.0 so that it
can properly use the eu-central-1 datacenter.

`section:key=value` and have it call `puppet config set` with those
options before starting puppet. This allows an agent to dynamically
configure it's certname, server or any other setting.

Previously we had an environment variable "IS_PE" or "BEAKER_IS_PE" to

to override the default and set the installation type as "FOSS".
The convention that has arisen is to use the negative in the IS_PE
environment variable (e.g. "IS_PE=no"). This brings that convention
into Beaker proper.

(QENG-1391) Use TLSv1 over SSLv3 for curl against PE

Prior to this commit, beaker was exclusively using SSLv3 against Puppet
Enterprise. Due to the recent information with POODLE, this commit updates
beaker to use TLS over SSL since we are disabling the use
of SSLv3.

(QENG-270) Added ntp_server as an option for host config

Before this, you couldn't specify an ntp server, so if you used the timesync option, it would only use the hard-coded value 'pool.ntp.org'.
This was a problem because occasionally that service couldn't be reached.  In order to fix this, we've allowed people to specify a server, so that they can get more reliable ntp services, and not see failures based on being able to reach one.

(QENG-1192) Use hostname specified by hypervisor everywhere

reviously, we would call out to `hostname` on the SUT when deploying
PE. This may give us a name that isn't resolvable our routable by
every host in the configuration. We should instead just use whatever
the hypervisor tells us is the correct way to connect to the host.

This also sneaks in a small change to the vmpooler hypervisor, to make
it return FQDNs. Using these FQDNs is really what this is all about.

If using versioned boxes from vagrant cloud and a new update is

versioned object you way wish to fix that initial download to a
fixed version or a version range.

(QENG-1264) Allow users to specify recursive option for scp_{from,to}

The fix for QENG-1128 caused scp_from and scp_to to ignore the
recursive flag. This caused all scp_from operations to be recursive,
which will cause a failure if trying to copy only a single file.

The fix to this, without regressing on QENG-1128, is to actually copy
the options hash locally so that we can modify it as needed for
defaults without updating any global data.

When installing from larger repositories, being able to specify depth can cut

checking out multiple repositories.
Due to the older git on some of the templates, this provides the older
--branch name --depth 1 commands, which means when using depth, one should
ensure the rev passed is a branch and not a single commit. Alternatively one
can add depth_branch => 'name' to repository and have that used instead of rev.

(QENG-840) Replace puppet.conf after stopping master

A webrick master watches the puppet.conf file and will try to reload and
reapply the settings catalog when it changes. The with_puppet_running_on
method gets into a race with this behavior, plus bug PUP-2834, because
it puts the backed up puppet.conf back into place *before* trying to
shut down the master process. This caused the master to periodically
read the new configuration, fail in applying it, crash, and then beaker
would try to kill the process. The process was already dead and the kill
command ends up failing. This then causes the test to fail.

This changes it so that for webrick masters, the backed up file isn't
moved back into place until *after* the master has been shut down. Since
rack masters don't ever try to reread the config file, this doesn't
affect them. Also, in the rack case, the file needs to be moved into
place *before* the master is stopped since it is actually fully
restarted.

(QENG-188) Allow foss runs to use service scripts, take 2

Prior to this commit, any run of beaker with a non-pe master that
attempted to stand up a master with a particular configuration in order
to test against it using the with_puppet_running_on() helper would
always stand up a webrick master by executing `puppet master <args>` and
then later stop it with `kill`.

The platform team needs to be able to run acceptance suites in which the
puppetmaster is started/stopped using package provided init scripts, or
by restarting apache if a passenger puppetmaster package is installed.

This PR takes the approach of enhancing Beaker::Host with a few query
methods controlled by host properties, either set in the hosts.cfg, or
directly on a master Beaker::Host instance during the execution of a
setup step.  The added properties are:

 * 'use-service' : if true, service scripts will be used instead of
manually starting a webrick master
 * 'passenger'   : if true, indicates a passenger package has been
installed, and by default graceful service restarts will be used
 * 'puppetservice' : the 'puppetservice' property has been added to the
Beaker::Host::Unix.foss_defaults with the value of 'puppetmaster'.  It
should be set to the appropriate service script name for passenger if a
passenger package has been installed.
 * 'graceful-restarts' : can be set false if you want to stop/start with
service scripts rather than use graceful restarts when running with
passenger

The Beaker::Host#uses_passenger! call may be used to set a host
appropriately for passenger.

The graceful restarts facility of the dsl helper's bounce method assumes
apache2 was used for passenger and that apach2ctl is available.

Any existing test suite which does not 'opt-in' to any of these service
host changes by specifying any of the above properties should not be
effected by this commit.  The exception to this is that PE runs will use
graceful restarts automatically with this commit.

There is also a spec related change to the FakeHost helper, which
previously was a stub pretending to provide Beaker::Host like facilities
and recording commands for review.  This became unwieldy when the
various query methods for use_service_scripts? is_using_passenger? and
so forth were added, and the FakeHost has been updated to instead use
Beaker::Host.create to provide a host instance that is then extended
with the MockedExec module stubbing the exec facilities for testing.

Ensure IS_PE only respects different values

Previously if we set the IS_PE or BEAKER_IS_PE environment variable at
all we would automatically make the run a PE run. This caused
non-obvious behavior for users that set IS_PE=false.

This changes the searching of the environment to only set the :type
option if [BEAKER_]IS_PE=yes|true.

(QENG-923) Ensure @codename is set if platform string has codename

Beaker 1.14.0 and up has a change to Beaker::Platform which ensures that
@version and @codename is set if the platform string contains the
version number, and that @version is set if platform string contains the
codename, but it fails to set the @codename in this later case.

Puppet currently has debian/ubuntu configs checked (used in ci) which
use platform strings of the form debian-wheezy-x86_64. We could change
these, but it looks like the intention of the Beaker::Platform object is
to provide @version and @codename (where codenames are used).

This patch ensures that @codename is set along with @version in these
cases.

(QENG-188) Allow foss runs to use service scripts

Prior to this commit, any run of beaker with a non-pe master that
attempted to stand up a master with a particular configuration in order
to test against it using the with_puppet_running_on() helper would
always stand up a webrick master by executing `puppet master <args>` and
then later stop it with `kill`.

The platform team needs to be able to run acceptance suites in which the
puppetmaster is started/stopped using package provided init scripts, or
by restarting apache if a passenger puppetmaster package is installed.

This PR makes a few additions to OptionsHash, Host and the DSL::Helpers
to allow us to distinguish foss hosts which were spun up from source
from those which were installed from packages.  And if we are working
with packages, whether we will be attempting to restart a running
service or stop/start using service scripts.

Previously there was no `Host#check_for_command` method, but
`Host#check_for_package` did a `which` (it effectively was checking for
the command). Now that we've separated out that behavior we need to use
the ones we mean in `InstallUtils#install_puppet()`. This is important
because when we fall back to a gem install of Puppet we ensure there is
a command `gem` available from (often) the package `rubygems`.

shouldn't be making any puppet calls using Beaker before the Puppet master is
run for the first time using init scripts since this will lead to

(QENG-716) install_package_version

This commit adds 'install_package_version' method to the DSL helper utils and an
associated method that given package name as well as optional version string
that will be used to construct a package name that includes a specific version
string for installation on the SUT.

This currently only supports apt and yum based package managers, as I am no
familiar enough with other platforms. For non apt or yum based platforms, an
exception will be raised.

* Honor the :silent option in host.exec
* Many logging functions seem to try to pass positional parameters in to

  This made it impossible to choose whether or not to add a newline.
* Remove call to logger.notify with bogus arity. Seems like "args" probably
  becomes an empty array which made this method call okay previously. However,
  if there are no arguments in "*args" then no args get passed down to
  optionally_color, thus the arity of the original "*args" is preserved.

(QENG-64) Fix ordering issue when deploying the frictionless agent

Previously, the puppet agent was not stopped on the master until all
nodes were deployed. This could cause a situation where the background
agent would be running when we attempt to deploy the frictionless
repo. In this situation, the agent run we kick off to deploy the repo
would fail. This causes the entire beaker process to bail.

We now stop the background agent immediately, preventing this
condition from occuring.

Use specified versions if possible

Previously we allowed passing :version, :facter_version, and/or
:hiera_version to `install_puppet` but only respected `:version` with
windows and osx, and the others only on osx. This will attempt to
install the versions specified for any package specified. The version
information is still optional on linux machines, and there is no way for
us to respect the dependency versions on windows (since our windows
package is an omnibus package).
```

(QENG-438) Pass feature flags to all instances of `apply_manifest_on`

Prior to this there was a number of configurable options that would
tweak Puppet's behavior when using apply_manifest_on. However there
was no good way of setting all instances of apply_manifest_on to use
a certain set of flags. e.g. set "future" parser to be true for a specific
run of suite without changing all of the tests to explicitly set the
future parser option on apply_manifest_on. This allows users to set default
flags to be passed to puppet when apply_manifest_on is called in the host
file, or in a pre-test step.

Example Host file:
  HOSTS:
    master:
      roles: [ 'master', 'agent' ]
      default_apply_opts:
        parser: future

Example BeakerRSpec spec_helper.rb
  hosts.each do |host|
    host[:default_apply_opts] ||= {}
    host[:default_apply_opts].merge!( :parser => 'future' ) if ENV['FUTURE_PARSER'] == 'true'
  end

With the nodeset config option 'docker_preserve_image' we can disable the image deletion.
This is useful when running in CI environments and multiple containers are built using the same dockerfile content and re-used allot of times.

Do not destructively consume ARGV

Previously we were calling parse! which has the side effect of deleting
options from ARGV as it recognizes them. To work around this behavior
in previous commits, the desired options needed to be saved before hand.
Simply not mutating ARGV is much easier. Also adds a test.

* Add a docker hypervisor (f1634157)


```
Add a docker hypervisor

This is a quite simple hypervisor, and only supports linux flavours
currently.  Many things around inter-node communications will
probably not work.

The basic approach is we spin up a new image based on an upstream
one, add a sshd to it, tag the image with the name of the host and
then create a container from it.  This container should then be
usable as a system under test.

The implementation is largely based on both the existing Beaker::Vagrant
hypervisor, and docker-kitchen.
https://github.com/portertech/kitchen-docker All bugs are mine.

Still a few things to do around finding existing nodes, but for now
it makes basic enough images that you can run no tests in 11 seconds.

```
PDB-554 Implement a new EC2 backend and add jenkins_build_url to tags

This patch implements a replacement for the blimpy backend. It replaces the
use of blimpy to launch EC2 nodes with the Amazon AWS::EC2 library.

This was introduced to provide more control over handling error states, without
the granular control of a lower level library we are relying on blimpy to have
error handling (which it largely does not).

My theory was that we could either improve blimpy to do more, or just replace
it with a better driver that allows us to maintain our provisioning code on
its own without worrying about an upstream project. Since we don't use blimpy
for anything else, and we don't want the delay of having an upstream project
release our changes replacement seemed like a better option.

The driver is initiated with the hypervisor: ec2 setting in the users template
files and is built to match the blimpy behaviour in the way it configures
security groups and key pairs. To a reasonable extent users using blimpy right
now should be able to switch over with very little change.

As an aside, I've also added the ability to pass through the BUILD_URL from
a jenkins job as a tag in EC2 (and I've added this code to GCE as well). This
allows a better traceback from VM's to a particular job so we can identify
zombied jobs better.

(maint) Install PE on windows synchronously

Previously, beaker would call msiexec in a way that would cause it to
run asynchronously. This worked pretty much by chance, because beaker
did enough other stuff before trying to run puppet on the Windows
machine.

This wraps the msiexec call in `start /w`, which waits for the
installation to finish before continuing. This ensures that puppet is
fully installed before beaker continues.
```
* (maint) Wrap windows PE installation in `cmd /C` (08de0d72)


```
(maint) Wrap windows PE installation in `cmd /C`

When cygwin converts the posix-style commandline that bash provides to
a windows-style one for calling msiexec, it adds quotes around some
arguments. These quotes cause msiexec to fail. By wrapping the msiexec
invocation in `cmd /C`, we use the windows command interpreter to
handle the command line instead of bash/cygwin. This avoids the
translation issues introduced by cygwin.

(QENG-326) Dump puppet logs on failed shutdown

Right now the puppet logs are only dumped if there was a failure to
start the service. That means that when there is a failure on shutdown
we are left in the dark. This adds dumping of the logs when a error is
raised in the shutdown process.

This also improves the FakeHost so that it can support the [] method
instead of having a catch-all stub. By implementing the method is makes
the fake more resilient to changes and reduces the need for stubs of
what is mostly a value object.

(QA-845) Allow PE upgrade version to be specified in the config

Previously, when doing an upgrade beaker could only get a version by
reading the LATEST file. This makes it difficult to track exactly
which version is going to be tested in a given test run. By allowing
the version to be specified in the config file, we can make sure
beaker installs precisely the PE version that we care about for
testing.

Fix regexp for finding ip address for Fedora

The previous command for finding the IP address of a host:

	ip a | awk '/g/{print$2}'

Picks up all kinds of stray entries, on Amazon Linux for example:

	# ip a | awk '/g/{print$2}'
	109.74.196.121/24
	2a01:7e00::f03c:91ff:fe96:e1e4/64
	gre0:
	0.0.0.0
	gretap0:
	ip6gre0:

On a Fedora 20 box hosted in EC2:

	# ip a|awk '/g/{print$2}'
	lo:
	eth0:
	10.232.140.48/26

This is because its just looking for the letter 'g' which is not accurate
enough. Some interface lines have the word 'group' for example.

Changing this to the actual word 'global' seems to solve it:

	# ip a | awk '/global/{print$2}'
	109.74.196.121/24

This has been tested to work on:

* Debian 6/7
* Fedora 18, 20
* Amazon Linux
* Redhat 5/6

So I believe the behaviour should still be consistent after this change.

3.2 includes a large database schema change. Part of the schema
migration is to validate availability of free space. On split
configurations, the dashboard upgrader will ask the user to make sure
there is sufficient space on the database node. We need to answer
"yes" to this from Beaker.

Previously, beaker only supported installing a frictionless agent if
it had the same platform as the master. This code allows heterogenous
deployments by properly classifying the master for the platform of
each frictionless node in the configuration.

This is (once again) kind of a quick-and-dirty solution. It'll get
cleaned up as part of QA-769, wherein we refactor the mess known as
the PE installation code.

Previously, there was no way to tell how long each beaker command took

track down a timing issue in acceptance testing on Windows.

This commit modifies the host object to log timing information when
beaker is run in debug mode. It uses the same logging prefix as is used
when displaying the executed command, e.g.

    a4e5hyo2m0ooom1 (master) $  cp /etc/puppet/puppet.conf ...

(QA-705) Create manifest files to apply

When applying puppet manifests with `puppet apply` beaker will generate
the manifest code and send it to `stdin`. This is troublesome for
debugging as the actual code is never shown and hard to replicate.

This commit causes the manifest code to be stored in a `.pp` file in
`/tmp` and apply that file so that it may be viewed and reused when
debugging. This is similar to how rspec-system does it.

Install agents using the frictionless agent install

This change adds logic for installing using the new curlbash style of

of install, we add a new agent role of "frictionless", which indicates
that the node should be installed in the new style. This simply causes
it not to download the PE tarball or generate answer files, and to curl
and run a script from the master (based on the platform tag).

Destroy vagrant hosts only if Vagrantfile exists

The new `vagrant destroy --force` run during the vagrant hypervisors
`provision` method added in #48 seems to fail if no `Vagrantfile` has
ever been created for a nodeset. This fixes that.

```
Gracefully handle lack of puppet.conf

When `#with_puppet_running_on` is executed, it attempts to back up
puppet.conf and replace it for the duration for the test. The old
behavior of the code would always try to back up the file regardless of
the existence of the file, and would fail when the copy failed. This
commit ensures that the puppet.conf file is only backed up when present,
and the temporary puppet.conf is returned to the original state
when the method returns.

Rename `fact` to `fact_on` for uniformity

The DSL method `fact` was recently added, but most dsl methods take the
form of `<method>_on` for multi-node functions and `<method>` for
running on a default node. This makes `fact_on()` run on designated
nodes, and `fact()` run on the default node.

Quote ruby interpolated data in bash commands

Bash conditionals demonstrate strange behaviors when not given an arg.
Given the following:

    if [ -f  ]; then
      echo "how did I get here?"
    fi
    #=> how did I get here?

Wrapping ruby interpolated variables in quotes act as expected:

    if [ -f '' ]; then echo
      "how did I get here?"
    else
      echo "the empty string is not a file"
    fi
    #=> the empty string is not a file

The moral of the story is that bash exists to make everybody sad.

causing a failure on a Windows 2012 template which had a group with a
'-' in it.

Instead of trying to specify what is valid, accept whatever the wmic
group indicates is a group, since it should know.

QE-364 Clean up line endings

When using `Beaker::Command` helpers such as `facter()` or even `on()`
the resulting output is often a single line and of interest for its
value. The newline returned at the end of the line is not relevant to
interests and ends up getting `.chomp` called on it in almost every
case.

This change chomps the final newline off of stdout and stderr output so
that tests can be more simply written without having to `.chomp`

* (maint) Correct solaris 11/10 package install/uninstall (8751772a)


```
(maint) Correct solaris 11/10 package install/uninstall

Solaris has different package handling between 11 and 10.  We were
correct on install for Solaris 11, but uninstall was Solaris 10.

Now differentiate between the two with the correct package handlers for
11 and 10 respectively.

This also corrects a bug checking for existing packages in Solaris 10.
The which command returns an exit code of 0, even if the command is not
found.  So we're testing stdout explicitly to see if a path to command
was returned.

```
Add a method to confine hosts for a specific test block

The Beaker::DSL::Helpers#confine method would change the test's array of
hosts at the point it was called, and any subsequent tests or tear down
blocks would only operate on that restricted subset of hosts.

This patch adds a confine_block method which allows you to confine hosts
for a specific block of code, ensuring that the hosts array is reset to
its original value after the block is done.  This allows you to confine
a subset of a test, but still have a teardown clean up all hosts, for
example.

(maint) Fix with_puppet_running_on for testing with packages

PuppetAcceptance::DSL::Helpers#with_puppet_running_on had incomplete
changes brought in from the pe Puppet::Acceptance::ConfigUtils, which I
think were being shadowed by the direct inclusion of ConfigUtils in
tests using with_puppet_running_on.

This patch finishes up the with_puppet_running_on implementation and
adds two things.  One a :__commandline_args__ option to allow passing of
commandline flags to puppet in addition to configuration settings.  And
two, an attempt to ensure that errors raised during setup or execution
of the block are not masked by a failure in teardown.

- made it possible to send different array than ARGV to
  command_line_parsing
- reworked recursive print out of options
- reordered merge of options in host.rb (ensure that defaults is lowest
  priority)
- renamed 'defaults' to 'presets' as these are options that can come
  from env vars exported before a test run
- fixed broken spec tests

* Dump syslog on either rhel or debian if fail to kill puppet master (65c7983a)


```
Dump syslog on either rhel or debian if fail to kill puppet master

It's very difficult to debug why we were unable to kill the puppet
master (presumably it died or was killed by an earlier action).  And
usually our vms are spun down after execution.  If it's a transient
issue, then trying to track it down in a controlled environment is
difficult as well.  So this takes a stab at dumping the default logdest
target (syslog) on either a rhel or debian based system.

The vcloud provisioning will never create a VM with the user-specified

templates.

As a special bonus, if any hosts don't have vmhostname set, we will
warn that they were likely not provisioned correctly in the first
place.

Revert "Ensure the consoleport is always a string."

This was stupid. YAML creates integers automatically by default, so
unless the consoleport was set via ENV it would be an integer
previously. Making the default a string didn't do anything to unify
the values.

This reverts commit ec28d512cc068c54d3918d160b599e9917e431f1.

Ensure the consoleport is always a string.

Previously, the consoleport would be a string if set by the
environment or a config file, but an integer if left at its
default. This changes the default to a string.

I'm changing the default to a string rather than converting the
env/cfg value to an integer because we have historically set the
consoleport in our config files, so this way it is less likely to
break things.

Specify if we are doing a PE run via env var

Previously we determined if we were running a PE suite based on what
setup option was chosen. As we move the setup of test suite out of the
harness the flags that would have told us whether or not we were running
a PE suite are no longer of use. Ideally we would allow the project
being tested to override the host defaults for values, but this that
would be a larger change than is currently scoped. In the mean time this
patch allows setting an environment variable to determine wether or not
this is a PE or FOSS suite run.

Remove setup steps that are PE specific

Previously we put all of the setup steps for all of Puppetlabs projects
in its test harness. As projects change the maintenance cost should be
shifted to the developers/projects that are changing. They are the best
to understand their particular projects setup/dependencies. We have
moved all of the PE setup tests into a separate repository but the
harness will still try to load these outdated setup steps. This cleans
up the duplicate and/or conflicting setup steps that are better specified in
the PE projects test suite.

[#20586] Ensure the assumed "setup" dir is relative to the harness, not CWD

Prior to this the harness assumed that a number of tasks were in it's
setup folder but it loaded them relative to the CWD. This causes issues
when trying to run the harness as a gem executable outside of the
traditional directory structure. This commit fixes that so that all
assumptions around the location of the 'setup' dir is relative to the
harness's root not the CWD.

Windows. When executed, the step installs the following cert:

  CN=GeoTrust Global CA, O=GeoTrust Inc., C=US

If the cert is already present, the `certutil` command still returns 0,
so no special `acceptable_exit_code` logic is required.

Without this, it was possible for an agent to check in between the

would continue without signing the cert because we could see it is
there. With this change, we now verify that the cert is signed, not
just that it exists.

```
During fleet.start retry call fleet.destroy and report on sleep

This addition to the fleet.start retry block will add a fleet.destroy call
before fleet.start is retried in case we need to do some cleanup for it
to work again. It is caught inside its own begin/rescue block and has a
timeout to stop it blocking forever.

I've also added reporting on the number of seconds we are sleeping before
retry.

Catch generic Fog exceptions for retry when using fleet.start

Previously we had been seeing multiple exceptions to do with AWS transient
failures:

    #<Fog::Errors::Error: Reload failed, Fog::Compute::AWS::Server i-7b97ba49 went away.>
    #<Fog::Compute::AWS::Error: RequestLimitExceeded => Request limit exceeded.>

This patch wraps the call to fleet.start in a retry wrapper, returning retry
count status each time, a random sleep (to work around API request limits)
and finally the ability to throw the original error if the exception
continues.

I see this as an initial start to adding resiliency to this problematic area,
to at least cater for the majority of our errors for now.

Only try to stop the master if we have a pidfile

Previously, on rhel6-32-1 I was noticing the test harness hang trying to
execute `bash -c kill $(cat )`, which blocked reading from stdin. The
issue occurred because I reverted the VM and did --no-install. As a
result, the `puppet master --configprint pidfile` command raised an
execption, which flowed through the top-level ensure block.

This commit moves the ensure block so that we only try to stop the
master if we're able to get its pidfile.

Retry SSH on network exceptions, fail on auth fail

means that errors like SSH failures will be masked as network failures.

connectivity and so forth, and explicitly rescues these for retry. It
also reraises the Net::SSH::AuthenticationFailed to clearly indicate
auth failures.

On that day all the developers of the world let out a great cry of agony, for they knew RUBY would keep his terrible promise. (2391b9aa)

Previously, we were using win32-security version 0.1.2, but we need to

as a dependency to one of the others.

This commit bumps the gem version. In the future, we will be able to do
`bundle install` (for 3.0.x and up), but am I don't want to break the
acceptance tests right now, as it would require reording this step (to
do the git clone, to get the Gemfile, and then do bundle install).

Basic tests for Hosts

This provides tests for most of the host's behaviors, save for `exec`
and `do_scp` which are very similar, but `exec` has a lot of knowledge
in it that should probably be elsewhere. So I've decided to hold off on
spec-ing it until I can refactor its friends at the same time.

`pretty_backtrace` only print the lines from test files unless in debug

Detect missing VMs and fail the setup process

Previously the vSphere integration made a "best effort" pass at the VMs: it
would look for them all, and then act only on the machines that it found.

This means that if a VM name was incorrectly specified or otherwise
unavailable the entire process would just silently skip over it, omitting real
and important test targets.

Now this is detected and a failure results: you can't skip over a VM any longer.

(#16307) handle solaris specially for bin and sbindir

This is specific to the pkg://solaris/runtime/ruby-18@1.8.7.334,5.11
package available from pkg.oracle.com and available from a full system installation of
solaris11.

The ruby available from the above has Config::CONFIG['bindir'] compiled in to /usr/ruby18/bin
unlike in other platforms and packages which has it set to the system directory /usr/bin
The same issue is present for sbin directory too.

Since puppet and facter need to be delivered to /usr/bin we can not rely on the compiled
in directory for this purpose when using the above package.

This fix updates the invocation of install.rb to pass the directories directly rather than
depend on the compiled in directories. (A better fix would be to rely on the native package
managers to deilver the puppet and facter binaries correctly to the system, so this is a
temporary fix until atleast that happens, or the upstream changes the ruby compiled in
settings in a future version).

This allows us multiple mechanisms to override the forge host, with a fall back
to the static 'forge-acceptance.puppetlabs.lan' host.

It also provides wrapper methodology for stubbing a host in general
`stub_hosts_on` and provides a forge specific wrapper `stub_forge_on`
so we can make our acceptance code more DRY.

To facilitate proper 'unstubbing' this patch also introduces the capability to
declare a teardown code block, that will always be called at the end of a test
case. This is a generic method, and can now be used by anyone for purposes
beyond the initial goal of this patch.

Add support for loading harness options from a file

This commit introduces a new command-line argument,
"--options-file".  If specified, this file will be
treated as a ruby file to be evaluated, and is
expected to return a hash.  The hash may contain
any of the "normal" options that the framework
supports.  It may also contain extra options
that are specific to the project that is being tested.

Any options passed to the harness on the command
line will be given precedence over the ones found
in the file.

Move install_from_git to reusable location

This commit introduces an InstallUtils module (which will likely
become a class, eventually) to house the "install_from_git" method
that used to live in setup/git/01_TestSetup.rb.  By moving this method
to a location under 'lib' instead of 'setup', it can be used during
the custom setup lifecycle phases of individual projects.  Previously
it could only be used implicitly via, e.g., --yagr option, and only
if the --type was set to 'git'.

* Add "node_name" method to Host class (c1886954)

Add "node_name" method to Host class

In certain tests it is very important for us to use
an agent's node_name_value rather than relying
on the hostname from the test config file (or
other possible values that may successfully
resolve in DNS).  For example, when testing
node activation and de-activation for puppetdb,
we *must* use the node_name_value or things
can go awry.

This commit adds a method to the host object
that allows us to retrieve the node_name_value
without having to hard-code the command for
acquiring it into all of the tests.  We might
want to consider similar methods for a few other
things such as FQDN.

* Move vmname option from fission-level to host-level (bcabafe4)

Move vmname option from fission-level to host-level

vmname is a generic attribute of a host, thus the option can be useful in
contexts outside of fission. This patch moves that option out of the fission
subsection and into the parent host section.

"I've been wanting to make explicit the distinction between name used by the
harness, hostname, and vmname for awhile. This is something we're going to need
in vSphere soon and I'd like to see 'vmname' as a key in the host hash above
the fission specific section (since I'll probably be using it in vSphere as
well before Lance ships)." -- Justin Stoller

```
Support for VMWare Fusion when using --vmrun

This provides support for reverting a VMWare Fusion machine to a particular
snapshot prior to executing tests.

Additional requirements on the Test Driver:
- Must have the 'fission' gem (including all its dependencies) installed
- Must have a ~/.fissionrc that points to the `vmrun` executable and where VMs
  can be found

You can then use the following arguments to systest:
- `--vmrun fusion` tells us to enable this feature. This is required.
- `--snapshot <name>`, where <name> is the snapshot name to revert to. This
  applies across *all* VMs, so it only makes sense if you want to use the same
  snapshot name for all VMs. This is optional.

For each host, you can (optionally) have a "fission" section with the following
(also optional) settings inside:

- `vmname`: This is useful if the hostname of the VM doesn't match the name of
  the .VMX file on disk. The alias should be something fission can load.
- `snapshot`: This is useful if you'd like to use different snapshots for each
  host. The value should be a valid snapshot name for the VM.

component to Windows style paths. So `C:\foo` becomes `C;C:\foo`

(#14554) Add hiera command support

This patch adds support for running hiera commands to the test harness.  You
can execute Hiera commands like this:

    on master, hiera(""), :acceptable_exit_codes => [1] do
      assert_output <<-OUTPUT
        STDERR> Please supply a data item to look up
      OUTPUT
    end

Add modules to Host Configuration Summary

Without this patch the set of modules installed into the puppet master
modulepath is not displayed in the Host Configuration Summary.  This is
a problem because I sometimes forget to switch the branch I'm working on
and I end up running the test suite against a branch that fails the
tests I'm currently working on.

This patch simply adds the array created by --modules to the config hash
object displayed by the summary.

The new summary looks like:

Without this patch the --modules command line option results in the
behavior of using git checkout -f on the puppet master systems using the
local branch.

This is a problem because I frequently re-write history in my topic
branches and the upstream branch will no longer be fast-forward-able
relative to the local branch reference.

The end result is that my changes aren't actually tested if I rewrite
history.

This patch fixes the problem by doing a hard reset of the local topic
branch against the upstream reference.  This ensures the local branch is
the exact same as the upstream reference.

The end result is that my changes are tested.  =)

Add --modules command line option to test modules

Without this patch the git acceptance type has no way to install
arbitrary Puppet modules.  We need this functionality to properly test
the Registry puppet module.

This patch fixes the problem by providing a --modules command line
option.  This option takes a list of URI's to Puppet module
repositories.  Each listed URI will be cloned into /opt/puppet-git-repos
on each master system using the 04_InstallModules setup step when using
--type git.

Individual test cases may then configure a modulepath directory that
symlinks in the modules we're testing are "installed" on the puppet
master systems.

The FOSS version of Puppet on Windows requires several gems to run. Up
until now, the necessary gems were part of the 'git' snapshot. However,
as we add more features, additional gems will be required. Rather than
update the snapshot each time, this commit adds a setup step that
installs/updates the gems we require. It is written fairly generically
so that platform-specific gems and behavior can be added.

Note this step only occurs in 'git' but not 'pe' because in the latter
case, the gems should be part of the installer itself.

(Maint) Ensure agent certs are signed before proceeding

Previously, there was a race condition whereby "slow agents" may not
submit their CSR before `03_PE-SignCerts` tries to sign them. As a
result, we might not sign anything (since exit code 24 is acceptable for
situations where the master is also an agent and its cert is always
autosigned). We would then get a failure later on in `05_Agent_test`
when validating that the agents could connect to the master.

This commit changes the test to validate that all of the agents'
certificates have been issued before proceeding. Note we only do this
for hosts that are only agents, because the master's cert is autosigned.

(Maint) Don't run puppet agent in the background during test run

Previously, the `setup/pe/01_PE-InstallPuppet.rb` and
`02_PE-InstallWindows.rb` tests would install the PE agent, and cause
the agent to run in the background every `runinterval` seconds.

Meanwhile, `setup/pe/05_Agent_test.rb` would try to run `puppet agent
--test` to verify that the agent could connect to the master, retrieve
its SSL certificate, etc.

This causes a second puppet process to start up and contend for the
puppet lock file.  Most of the time the first puppet process releases
the lock file and sleeps for 30 minutes, before the 05_Agent_test runs.
But sometimes the the first process still has the file locked, e.g.
because it's pluginsync'ing from the master. If so, 05_Agent_test fails
with `notice: Run of Puppet configuration client already in progress;
skipping`

Since none of the PE acceptance tests rely on having a puppet agent
running in the background, this commit stops all agents before
proceeding. The logic for how to stop the agent was copied from
`setup/pe_co/05_Agent_test.rb`.

Previously, when running windows acceptance tests, the ntp step was
sometimes not updating the clock. As a result, the SSL sanity test would
fail due to mismatched clocks.

It turns out the `/update` flag does not necessarily update the client's
time. It just applies the configuration changes, e.g. ntp server IP
address, so that the Windows service can see them. An explicit /resync
is required to force an immediate ntp update. Also the resync occurs
sychronously, because we're not using the `/nowait` switch.

```
Maint: Use short, unquoted paths on Windows

Previously, we quoted the puppetpath and puppetvardir host properties
on Windows because they often contain spaces, e.g. C:\Documents and
Settings. However, when these properties are used in bash commands, it
can result in expected consequences. For example,

   if [ -d "#{agent['puppetpath']}" ]

checks if a directory named \"C:\Documents and Settings\...\" exists,
where the quotes are interpreted as part of the path. This was causing
the `with_master_running_on` method to fail to delete Windows agents
vardir contents.

This commit changes the puppetpath and puppetvardir to always return
short versions of Windows paths with forward slashes, e.g.

    C:/DOCUME~1/ALLUSE~1/APPLIC~1/PuppetLabs/puppet/var/client_data

This eliminates the need for these paths to be quoted, and makes it
easier for bash commands to do what you expect in a cross-platform
way.
```
* Maint: Agent vardir sometimes not deleted between test cases (12f45cf2)


```
Maint: Agent vardir sometimes not deleted between test cases

The `with_master_running_on` method was recently updated to delete the
contents of each agents' vardir so that cached catalogs from previous
runs don't pollute subsequent runs, and cause the agent to return 0
exit code, when it shouldn't, for example.

However, commit `ba57ee5c` refactored this code and caused a
regression, as it was only deleting the agent's vardir if the
directory existed on the host driving the tests, not the system under
test. It also removed the `-f` flag.

This commit reinstates the `-f` flag and moves the `File.exists?`
check so that it is executed on the agent. This is necessary because
calling `for f in /foo/*` returns the literal string '/foo/*' if the
directory foo does not exist.

...snip...

It would filter out the localhost line and cause odd errors later
on. This changes the early step to filter out only the lines that
we add (#{ip} #{hostname})

Allow multiple exitcodes for initial puppet agent run

Prior to this (a change I made to not effectively bounce
the agent service) only accepted an exit code of 0.

This worked for my testing because of conditions that caused
the agent to check in once before the test was actually ran.
The issue is when (and this is the typical case in CI) the test
is the first agent run to check in there will usually be
successful changes applied and puppet will exit with 2.

This adds 2 as an acceptable exit code.

(#11944) Add Unix and Windows exec commands

This commit defines a set of methods for executing common commands on
Unix and Windows, e.g. touch, echo. This way all of logic for
performing exec commands is in one place, rather than scattered
throughout each exec test case.

On Windows, echo is a shell built-in, but there isn't a shell exec
provider, so it has to be wrapped within a cmd.exe shell. Touch is not
a built-in, but it can be faked using echo. Also, we have to use
backslashes when referencing the absolute path to cmd.exe and trying
to invoke it via ssh/cygwin. I'm not entirely sure why, but I can
reproduce the error when running a bash shell on the local Windows
box. The fix is to use backslashes for the absolute path.

This commit assumes the windows directory is in c:/windows, which
isn't ideal. It could be made more robust by querying the remote
system for its ENV['windir'] and ENV['COMSPEC'], or allowing them to
be configured, but that's more than I want to do right now.

Note the Windows implementation uses cygpath to translate from a posix
path, e.g. /tmp, to a "mixed" windows path, e.g. C:/cygwin/tmp, so
that the latter can be passed to puppet and still be a valid fully
qualified path on Windows.

This is totally a sledge hammer kind of fix, but the issue is:
CI will be run with snapshots that are ensured to have known good
setups, skipping based on the --vmrun option would be the best for CI

Locally many will be able to use this as is if they also have known
good snapshots.

I also try to automate as much as I can locally testing PE pre-2.0.
The changes that I'd like to introduce to automate those builds are
not trivial and keeping these files is helpful for my work in that area.

NOTE: This works for me locally with a similar (but not exact) workflow
to CI. It *should* work in CI.

allow extra environment vars for puppet commands

When working on some tickets relating to setting system locales (Facter #12012, Puppet #11860), I came across a situation where I needed to be able to set some environment variables before running puppet commands in my acceptance tests.  This changeset adds the ability to pass in an optional ":environment" hash when calling "apply_manifest_on"; the key/value pairs in this hash will be set as environment variables for the duration of the execution of the "puppet apply" operation.

This implementation isn't ideal, but the implementation details are not very visible in the actual acceptance test syntax.  We might want to re-work the implementation later, but for now this was the only reasonably easy way to pull it off.

Also--this logic could very easily be extended to work for other puppet commands besides "apply", but hasn't at this point in time.

This skips over the master, although not the validation that the certificate
works, which keeps things running as expected.

(#11743) Delete contents of agent var directory in agent/master tests

Previously, the
`helpful_error_message_when_hostname_not_match_server_certificate`
test would correctly report that the server's hostname didn't match
its certificate, however, the test would attempt to use a cached
catalog. If one was present, for example, the 03_ValidateSignCert step
causes the agent to retrieve an empty catalog, then the agent would
apply the catalog and return exit code 0, causing the test to fail.

This commit deletes the contents of the agents' vardir, but not the
vardir itself. This change will only affect tests that use the
`with_master_running_on` method which does not include PE.

This adds the ability to request a PTY for a specific test, which will cause
one to be allocated - or a hard failure to occur.

This is not made the default for two reasons:

1. It changes behaviour around which scripts are run on exec.
2. It potentially changes logging behaviour.

(#11767) Use newer --dns_alt_names option

Previously, the git setup steps were using the old deprecated
--certdnsnames option when generating the master's csr. It was also
using a colon-delimited list instead of a comma-separated list. As a
result, the puppetmasters certificate generated during
03_ValidateSignCert.rb contained bogus X509 Subject Alt Names:

  X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
    DNS:centos-55-64-1.puppetlabs.lan,
    DNS:puppet:centos-55-64-1:centos-55-64-1

This was not noticed earlier, because the agent never retrieved its
ssl certificate in the setup steps, which is something I recently
changed so that we'd validate that the agent can connect via SSL to
the master in the setup steps, rather than later during the acceptance
tests.

Previously, when running the first acceptance tests from the puppet
repo, the test would delete all of the hosts ssl directories, and
regenerate the certs, but this time using the correct --dns_alt_names
option.

This commit just updates the setup steps to also use the
--dns_alt_names option with a comma delimited list of names to include
in the puppet master's certificate.

like:

    on hosts, 'rm -rf #{host["puppetpath"]/ssl}'

and have the command be evaluated in the context of each host.

This commit adds a generic HostCommand that lazily evaluates its
command string, in the `Kernel.eval` sense, with a binding containing
the `host` variable. So now it is possible to do:

    on hosts, host_command('rm -rf #{host["puppetpath"]/ssl')

which will remove the ssl directory from each host using each hosts'
`puppetpath` configuration. Note that we're using single quotes to
avoid string interpolation.

(#11767) Don't assume host['puppetpath'] is /etc/puppet

Previously, the acceptance tests failed on Windows because puppet.conf
does not live in /etc/puppet on Windows.

This commit changes the default value of `puppetpath` for Windows
hosts relative to the CommonAppData folder. Sadly, the location of
this folder is different between 2003 and 2008, and the folder usually
contains spaces, e.g. C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application
Data.

This commit uses the Cygwin utility `cygpath` to lookup the
CommonAppData folder, whose id is 35 (0x23). See the following for
known-folder ids:

  http://source.winehq.org/source/include/shlobj.h

It also updates the acceptance tests to use the `puppetpath` value when
appending the `server` property to the `agent` section of the hosts'
`puppet.conf`. And since the CommonAppData folder contain spaces, the
value of `puppetpath` is quoted on Windows.

This commit simply wraps the puppet and facter commands within a

(#11767) Don't create a new SSH connection for each TestCase

Previously, a new Host instance was being created for each combination
of TestSuite, TestCase, and Host. As a result, multiple SSH
connections, including SSH authentication, were being performed
unnecessarily. This was actually a regression introduced in
b62f8056f0b5499ad9341487c1fca6f328c0830b.

Given a sufficiently large number of TestCases, the test driver and/or
system under test could run out of file descriptors.

This commit moves the creation of hosts to the top-level, so that the
same SSH connection can be reused across multiple TestSuites and
TestCases. In other words, the acceptance tests will make at most one
SSH connection per host.

This commit also adds a method for closing the SSH connection (if one
was created) and explicitly closes the connection when the tests are
done.

(#11767) Move defaults into type-specific hosts

Previously, the acceptance tests were adding POSIX default paths to
the PATH environment variable passed to Windows hosts, e.g. /usr/bin,
which happens to correspond to the location of the Cygwin utilities
that we don't want the tests to use on Windows.

This commit creates host subclasses that contain the default paths that
are applicable for that platform. It also adds a `Host.create` factory
method that knows how to create the appropriate type of `Host` instance
based on the platform specified in the configuration file.

If we need to support PE-specific install locations on Windows, then it
will be easy to change (in one place).

Ideally, we should only create the puppet user and group in a `master`
role (when we need to switch uid). However, due to bug #9862 the puppet
group is required on Unix, even for `puppet agent` and `puppet apply`.

Since #9862 doesn't apply on Windows, we can safely skip creating the
puppet user and group on Windows.

```
(#11621) Add --dhcp-renew option to enable lease renewal

Without this patch the DHCP lease renewal step of the early setup phase
is always executed.

This is a problem on my CentOS 6 VMware Fusion VM because the interface
is brought down, disconnecting the SUT from the network before the ifup
command can be issued.  This leaves the target system offline and
subsequent steps timeout.

This patch works around the problem by providing and documenting the
--dhcp-renew option to disable renewals.

(#11618) Add root SSH key synchronization setup step

Without this patch the target systems under test may have out of date
authorized key files since they're usually VM snapshots.  This is
problem if there is a test problem requiring investigating by technical
staff.

This patch fixes the problem by synchronizing the
~root/.ssh/authorized_keys file in the setup early phase.  The behavior
happens by default on all systems.  We assume it will work and intended
to come back and filter out target nodes that are known not to work.

A command line option, --no-root-keys is provided to disable this change
in behavior.
