# Beaker

Beaker is a test harness focused on acceptance testing via interactions between multiple (virtual) machines. It provides platform abstraction between different Systems Under Test (SUTs), and it can also be used as a virtual machine provisioner - setting up machines, running any commands on those machines, and then exiting.

Beaker runs tests written in Ruby, and provides additional Domain-Specific Language (DSL) methods.  This gives you access to all standard Ruby along with acceptance testing specific commands.

# Installation

See [Beaker Installation](docs/tutorials/installation.md).

# Documentation

Documentation for Beaker can be found in this repository in
[the docs/ folder](docs/README.md).

## Table of Contents

- [Tutorials](docs/tutorials) take you by the hand through the steps to setup a beaker run. Start here if youâ€™re new to Beaker or test development.
- [Concepts](docs/concepts) discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
- [Rubydocs](http://rubydoc.info/github/puppetlabs/beaker/frames) contains the technical reference for APIs and other aspects of Beaker. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
- [How-to guides](docs/how_to) are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Beaker works.
