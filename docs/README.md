## Table of Contents

- [Concepts](concepts) discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
- [Rubydocs](http://rubydoc.info/github/puppetlabs/beaker/frames) contains the technical reference for APIs and other aspects of Beaker. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
