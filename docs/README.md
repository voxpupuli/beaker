Documentation for Beaker can be found in this repository in [the docs/ folder](README.md).

## Table of Contents

- [Tutorials](tutorials) take you by the hand through the steps to setup a
beaker run. Start here if you’re new to Beaker or test development.
- [Concepts](concepts) discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high
level and provide useful background information and explanation.
- [Rubydocs](http://rubydoc.info/github/puppetlabs/beaker/frames) contains the
technical reference for APIs and other aspects of Beaker. They describe how it
works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
- [How-to guides](how_to) are recipes. They guide you through the steps
involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than
tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Beaker works.
