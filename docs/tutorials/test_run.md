# Beaker Test Runs

A Beaker test run consists of two primary phases: an SUT provision phase and a suite execution phase. After suite execution, Beaker defaults to cleaning up and destroying the SUTs. Leave SUTs running with the `--preserve-hosts` flag.

## Provisioning

* Using supported hypervisors, provision SUTs for testing on
* Do any initial configuration to ensure that the SUTs can communicate with beaker and each other
* skip with `--no-provision`
* Provisioning also runs some basic setup on the SUTs
  * Validation
    * Check the SUTs for necessary packages (curl, ntpdate)
    * skip with `--no-validate`
  * Configuration
    * Do any post-provisioning configuration to the SUTs
    * skip with `--no-configure`

## Execution

* Execute the files specified in each of the suites; for further documentation,
  please refer to [Test Suites & Failure Modes](test_suites.md)
