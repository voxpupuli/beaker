# Beaker Quick Start Tasks

We have developed some rake tasks to help new Beaker users get up and running quickly with writing and running tests.

## Pre-requisites

* You will need to have already completed the Beaker installation tutorial - [Beaker Installation](installation.md)
* Hypervisors are services that provision SUTs for Beaker. We have made two available in this quick start guide to allow you to get up and running. See the docs on how to setup [Vmpooler](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker-vmpooler/blob/master/vmpooler.md) and [Vagrant](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker-vagrant/blob/master/docs/vagrant.md).

## How to use them

To use the tasks, you need to put the following line at the top of your project's rake file:

```rake
    require 'beaker/tasks/quick_start'
```

To check that you have access to the quickstart tasks from your project, run:

```console
    rake --tasks
```

You should see them listed along with any rake tasks you have defined in your local project rakefile:

```rake
    rake beaker_quickstart:gen_hosts[hypervisor]  # Generate Default Beaker Host Config File, valid options are: vmpooler or vagrant
    rake beaker_quickstart:gen_pre_suite           # Generate Default Pre-Suite
    rake beaker_quickstart:gen_smoke_test          # Generate Default Smoke Test
    rake beaker_quickstart:run_test[hypervisor]   # Run Default Smoke Test, after generating default host config and test files, valid
    options are: vmpooler or vagrant
```

## Tasks

### Hypervisor Argument

Some of the tasks below take a 'hypervisor' argument that you can pass either 'vmpooler' or 'vagrant' to. If you leave it empty, the task will default to using 'vagrant'.

Example:

```console
    $ rake beaker_quickstart:gen_hosts[vmpooler]
```

If you have the zsh shell then you will need to escape the square brackets:

```console
    rake beaker_quickstart:gen_hosts\[vmpooler\]
```

### Generate tasks

These tasks are standalone and can be run independently from each other to generate the desired files.

* beaker_quickstart:gen_hosts  (generates default host config)
* beaker_quickstart:gen_pre_suite  (generates default pre-suite)
* beaker_quickstart:gen_smoke_test  (generates default smoke test)

#### gen_hosts

To run:

```console
    $ rake beaker_quickstart:gen_hosts[hypervisor]
```

The gen_hosts task will create a file 'default_hypervisor_hosts.yaml' in acceptance/config.

If the file already exists, it will not be overwritten. This will allow you to play around with the config yourself, either by manually editing the file or by using beaker-hostgenerator to generate a new hosts config.

Vagrant file (ubuntu 14 master and agent):

```yaml

    HOSTS:
      ubuntu1404-64-1:
        pe_dir:

### `gen_pre_suite`

To run:

```console
    $ rake beaker_quickstart:gen_pre_suite
```

This task will generate a default Beaker pre-suite file. The gen_pre-suite task will create a file 'default_pre_suite.rb' in acceptance/setup. If the file already exists, it will not be overwritten. This will allow you to edit the pre_suite file yourself if required.

pre_suite file:

```ruby
    install_puppet
```

See the [Test Suites doc](test_suites.md) in this directory for more information on pre-suites.

### `gen_smoke_test`

To run:

```console
    rake beaker_quickstart:gen_smoke_test
```

This task will generate a default Beaker smoke test file. The gen_smoke_test task will create a file 'default_smoke_test.rb' in acceptance/tests. If the file already exists, it will not be overwritten. This will allow you to edit the test file yourself if required.

smoke test file:

```ruby
    test_name 'puppet install smoketest' do
      step 'puppet install smoketest: verify \'puppet help\' can be successfully called on
      all hosts' do
            hosts.each do |host|
              on host, puppet('help') 
            end
      end
    end
```

This smoke test will check that Puppet has been successfully installed on the hosts.

For more information on the Beaker dsl methods available to you in your tests see - [Beaker dsl](../how_to/the_beaker_dsl.md)

### Run task

The beaker_quickstart:run_test task will run all the above tasks in sequential order, to generate a hosts file, pre-suite file, smoke test and then use these files to perform a Beaker test run. If the files already exist (see below for further info on file names and location) then they will not be overwritten.

#### run_test

To run:

```console
    $ rake beaker_quickstart:run_test[hypervisor]
```

This task will run the above 3 tasks in sequential order and then execute a Beaker test run using all 3 files.

```console
    $ beaker --hosts acceptance/config/default_vmpooler_hosts.yaml --pre-suite acceptance/setup/default_pre_suite.rb --tests acceptance/tests/default_smoke_test.rb
```

You will end up with provisioned hosts with puppet installed and a test check executed to verify that puppet was installed.
