    # Any custom assertions for Test::Unit or minitest live here. You may
    # include them in your own testing if you wish, override them, or re-open
    # the class to register new ones for use within
    # {Beaker::TestCase}.
    #
    # You may use any test/unit assertion within your assertion. The
    # assertion below assumes access to the method #result which will
    # contain the output (according to the interface defined in
    # {Beaker::Result}). When writing your own, to make them more
    # portable and less brittle it is recommended that you pass the result
    # or direct object for asserting against into your assertion.

    module Assertions
      include Test::Unit::Assertions

      # Make assertions about the content of console output.
      #
      # By default, each line of +output+ is assumed to come from STDOUT.
      # You may specify the stream explicitly by annotating the line with a
      # stream marker. (If your line literally requires any stream marker at
      # the beginning of a line, you must prefix the line with an explicit
      # stream marker.)  The currently recognized markers are:
      #
      # * "STDOUT> "
      # * "STDERR> "
      # * "OUT> "
      # * "ERR> "
      # * "1> "
      # * "2> "
      #
      # Any leading common indentation is automatically removed from the
      # +output+ parameter.  For cases where this matters (e.g. every line
      # should be indented), you should prefix the line with an explicit
      # stream marker.
      #
