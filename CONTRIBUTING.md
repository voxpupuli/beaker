# How To Contribute To Beaker

Contributions are welcomed. Simple bug fixes and minor enhancements will usually be accepted. Larger features should be discussed with a team member before you invest in developing them with the expectation that they will be merged.

## Recommended Tools

It may be necessary to test Beaker against multiple versions of Ruby. The maintainers use [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage multiple Ruby versions; you can install it with Homebrew. You'll also want [`rbenv-bundler`](https://github.com/carsomyr/rbenv-bundler) to keep Gem dependencies from conflicting.

## Getting Started

Beaker does not use GitHub Issues, but an internal ticketing system running Jira that interfaces with other services. To be accepted by the maintainers, changes must follow this workflow and tagging scheme. See [ticket process doc](docs/concepts/ticket_process.md) for a

* Create a [Jira account](http://tickets.puppetlabs.com)
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue on Jira, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * File the ticket in the [BKR project](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20BKR)
* Fork the [Beaker repository on GitHub](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker)

## Installation/Setup for Development

While most users will use Beaker as a Gem installed from some repository, you will need a live repo to work with. Here's how to configure Beaker and its dependencies so you can start contributing.

* Clone your fork of Beaker
* Install Beaker's dependencies into `vendor/bundle`:
  ```console
    $ bundle install --path vendor/bundle
  ```
  * Installing the dependencies globally ~~may~~ *will probably* cause conflicts and is not recommended.
  * Please use `vendor/bundle`, not `_vendor` or `.vendor`.
* Ensure the spec tests pass:
  ```console
    $ rake test:spec # assuming you have rbenv-bundler
    # or
    $ bundle exec rake test:spec # if you're *sure* your dependencies are tidy
  ```

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from your fork of [puppetlabs/beaker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker).
  * Please title the branch after the beaker ticket you intend to address, i.e. `BKR-1234`.
* Make commits of logical units. If your commits are a mess, you may be asked to [rebase or at least squash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) your PR.
  * Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format:
  ```
    (BKR-1234) Make the example in CONTRIBUTING imperative and concrete

    Without this patch applied the example commit message in the CONTRIBUTING document is not a concrete example.  This is a problem because the contributor is left to imagine what the commit message should look like based on a description rather than an example.  This patch fixes the problem by making the example concrete and imperative.

    The first line is a real life imperative statement with a ticket number from our issue tracker.  The body describes the behavior without the patch, why this is a problem, and how the patch fixes the problem when applied.
  ```
* During the time that you are working on your patch the master Beaker branch may have changed - be sure to [rebase](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) on top of [Beaker's](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker) master branch before you submit your PR.  A successful rebase ensures that your PR will merge cleanly.

#### Courtesy

Please do not introduce personal ignores into the `.gitignore`, such as IDE configurations, editor version files, or personal testing detritus. You may find it valuable to add the first two to [a global ignore](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/#create-a-global-gitignore), and the third to [a repository-level ignore](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/#explicit-repository-excludes).

### Testing

Submitted PR's will be tested in a series of spec and acceptance level tests - the results of these tests will be evaluated by a Beaker team member, as acceptance test results are not accessible by the public. Testing failures that require code changes will be communicated in the PR discussion.

* Make sure you have added [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) tests that exercise your new code.  These test should be located in the appropriate `beaker/spec/` subdirectory.  The addition of new methods/classes or the addition of code paths to existing methods/classes requires additional RSpec coverage.
  * Beaker uses RSpec 3.1.0+, and you should **NOT USE** deprecated `should`/`stub` methods - **USE** `expect`/`allow`. See a nice blog post from 2013 on [RSpec's new message expectation syntax](http://teaisaweso.me/blog/2013/05/27/rspecs-new-message-expectation-syntax/).
  * Run the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken, using `rake test`
    * **Bonus**: if possible ensure that `rake test` runs without failures for additional Rubies (versions 1.9.3 and above).

### Documentation

* Add an entry in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Refer to the CHANGELOG itself for message style/form details.
* Make sure that you have added documentation using [YARD](http://yardoc.org/) as necessary for any new code introduced. See [DOCUMENTING](DOCUMENTING.md).
* More user friendly documentation will be required for PRs unless exempted. Documentation lives in the [docs/ folder](docs).

## Making Trivial Changes

### Maintenance

For changes of a trivial nature, it is not always necessary to create a new ticket in Jira. In this case, it is appropriate to start the first line of a commit with `(MAINT)` instead of a ticket/issue number.

````
    (MAINT) Fix whitespace

    - remove additional spaces that appear at EOL
````

### Version Bump For Gem Release

To prepare for a new gem release of Beaker the `version.rb` file is updated with the upcoming gem version number.  This is submitted with `(GEM)` instead of a ticket/issue number.

````
     (GEM) Update version for Beaker 1.16.1
````

### History File Update

To prepare for a new gem release of Beaker (after the version has been bumped) the `HISTORY.md` file is updated with the latest GitHub log.  This is submitted with `(HISTORY)` instead of a ticket/issue number.

````
    (HISTORY) Update history for release of Beaker 1.16.1
````

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to [Beaker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker)
* Update your ticket
  * Update your [Jira](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20BKR) ticket to mark that you have submitted code and are ready for it to be considered for merge (Status: Ready for Merge).
  * Add a link to the pull request

PRs are reviewed as time permits.
